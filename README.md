In short: It's a Thunderbird Quick Filter Bar extension.

See this blog post to understand what this extension does in greater detail:

Implementation Notes that are important:

- This extension was originally developed during the transitional jetpack
  period when it was supported to use XUL overlays and the jetpack guts.

- It is possible to revisit that halcyon time period by disabling the bootstrap
  flag in the install.rdf file and making sure we have component/contract lines
  in our chrome.manifest.  Annoyingly it appears cfx generates a new classid
  every time we run "cfx xpi", so I have just been modifying the produced xpi's
  harness-options.json and install.rdf to reuse the class id from the
  chrome.manifest and mark it as not a bootstrap extension.
